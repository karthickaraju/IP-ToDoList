ToDoList Specification

1. Project Description

1.1 Requirements: 
               The project is to create a ToDoList application to simplify Usersâ€™s task management which can help them to list down the tasks, to get organised and get things done. This application allows users to use a text-based user interface via the command-line. With this application the user should be able to create new tasks and assign them a id, title, due date, project and status. The user should also be able to edit/update the task, change the status, search tasks and remove tasks. They can view the collection of tasks sorted by date and project. They can also quit and save the current task list to file and then restart the application with the former state restored. 
               
1.2 User Interface
The user interface should be similar as shown below:
- Welcome to ToDoList
- You have X tasks to do and Y tasks are done!
- Pick an option:
- (2) Add New Task
- (3) Remove Task
- (4) Edit task (update, mark as done)
- (5) Save and Quit
